# Description

In this project, a new discrete-event network simulator, called Days, has been implemented. It uses process-based simulation, and models each process to be simulated as a coroutine in Rust.

# Repository Guidelines

## Project Structure & Module Organization
- `src/` contains the Rust crate. Key modules live in `src/flows/`, `src/schedulers/`, `src/switches/`, `src/topos/`, `src/utils/`, and optional layer-2 protocol implementations in `src/l2/`.
- `lean/` contains Lean code that checks several protocols, including DCQCN and PFC, for conformance to their protocol specifications.
- `src/main.rs` is the CLI entry point; `src/lib.rs` exposes the library API.
- `tests/` holds integration tests, with `.toml` fixtures alongside test files (for example `tests/wrr.rs` + `tests/wrr_seed.toml`).
- `configs/` stores example simulation configs; `examples/` and `docs/docs/examples/` show runnable scenarios.
- `docs/` contains the MkDocs site (`docs/mkdocs.yml`, content under `docs/docs/`, e.g. `docs/docs/design-notes/l2.md`).
- `logs/` and `target/` are generated artifacts and should stay uncommitted.

## Build, Test, and Development Commands
- `cargo build` builds the default simulator.
- `cargo build --features l2,l2_pfc` enables L2/PFC support (still controlled by config at runtime).
- `cargo run --release --bin days -- configs/simple.toml` runs a sample simulation from the repo.
- `RUST_LOG=debug days configs/simple.toml` runs the installed binary with verbose logging.
- `cargo fmt --all` formats Rust code; `cargo clippy --all-features` runs linting.
- `cargo test --features test -- --show-output` runs unit + integration tests.
- `cargo nextest run --all-features --no-capture` is the preferred faster test runner if installed.

## Coding Style & Naming Conventions
- Follow `rustfmt` (style edition 2024 per `rustfmt.toml`); use 4-space indentation and no tabs.
- Rust naming: `snake_case` for files/modules/functions, `PascalCase` for types, `SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE` for constants.
- Keep config examples in TOML under `configs/` or `tests/*.toml` when they back a test.

## Testing Guidelines
- New behavior should include a `tests/*.rs` integration test and any required TOML fixtures.
- Name tests after the feature they validate (e.g., `tests/wfq.rs`, `tests/drop_red.rs`).
- Run `cargo test --features test -- --show-output` before submitting changes.

## Commit & Pull Request Guidelines
- Recent commits use short, imperative, capitalized subjects, often with backticks for commands and optional PR refs like `(#77)`.
- Keep commit subjects focused; include related issue/PR references when applicable.
- PRs should describe the change, list test commands run, and note any config files used to reproduce results or output changes.

## Configuration & Logging Tips
- Simulation behavior is driven by TOML configs; prefer adding new examples under `configs/` and referencing them in docs/tests.
- Use `log_path` in configs to keep output contained, and avoid committing large logs.

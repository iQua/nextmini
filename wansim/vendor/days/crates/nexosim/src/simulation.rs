//! Discrete-event simulation management.
//!
//! This module contains most notably the [`Simulation`] environment, the
//! [`SimInit`] simulation bench builder, the [`Mailbox`] and [`Address`] types
//! as well as miscellaneous other types related to simulation management.
//!
//! # Simulation lifecycle
//!
//! The lifecycle of a simulation bench typically comprises the following
//! stages:
//!
//! 1. instantiation of models and their [`Mailbox`]es,
//! 2. connection of the models' output/requestor ports to input/replier ports
//!    using the [`Address`]es of the target models,
//! 3. instantiation of a [`SimInit`] simulation bench builder and migration of
//!    all models and mailboxes to the builder with [`SimInit::add_model`],
//! 4. initialization of a [`Simulation`] instance with [`SimInit::init`],
//!    possibly preceded by the setup of a custom clock with
//!    [`SimInit::with_clock`],
//! 5. discrete-time simulation, which typically involves scheduling events and
//!    incrementing simulation time while observing the models outputs.
//!
//! The basic information necessary to run a simulation is available in the
//! [crate-level documentation](crate), and in the [`SimInit`] and
//! [`Simulation`] documentation. The next section complement this information
//! with a set of practical recommendations that can help run and troubleshoot
//! simulations.
//!
//! # Mailbox capacity
//!
//! A [`Mailbox`] is a buffer that store incoming events and queries for a
//! single model instance. Mailboxes have a bounded capacity, which defaults to
//! [`Mailbox::DEFAULT_CAPACITY`].
//!
//! The capacity is a trade-off: too large a capacity may lead to excessive
//! memory usage, whereas too small a capacity can hamper performance and
//! increase the likelihood of deadlocks (see next section). Note that, because
//! a mailbox may receive events or queries of various sizes, it is actually the
//! largest message sent that ultimately determines the amount of allocated
//! memory.
//!
//! The default capacity should prove a reasonable trade-off in most cases, but
//! for situations where it is not appropriate, it is possible to instantiate
//! mailboxes with a custom capacity by using [`Mailbox::with_capacity`] instead
//! of [`Mailbox::new`].
//!
//! # Deadlocks
//!
//! While the underlying architecture of NeXosim—the actor model—should prevent
//! most race conditions (including obviously data races which are not possible
//! in safe Rust) it is still possible in theory to generate deadlocks. Though
//! rare in practice, these may occur due to one of the below:
//!
//! 1. *query loopback*: if a model sends a query which loops back to itself
//!    (either directly or transitively via other models), that model would in
//!    effect wait for its own response and block,
//! 2. *mailbox saturation loopback*: if an asynchronous model method sends in
//!    the same call many events that end up saturating its own mailbox (either
//!    directly or transitively via other models), then any attempt to send
//!    another event would block forever waiting for its own mailbox to free
//!    some space.
//!
//! The first scenario is usually very easy to avoid and is typically the result
//! of an improper assembly of models. Because requestor ports are only used
//! sparingly in idiomatic simulations, this situation should be relatively
//! exceptional.
//!
//! The second scenario is rare in well-behaving models and if it occurs, it is
//! most typically at the very beginning of a simulation when models
//! simultaneously and mutually send events during the call to [`Model::init`].
//! If such a large amount of events is deemed normal behavior, the issue can be
//! remedied by increasing the capacity of the saturated mailboxes.
//!
//! Deadlocks are reported as [`ExecutionError::Deadlock`] errors, which
//! identify all involved models and the count of unprocessed messages (events
//! or requests) in their mailboxes.
//!
//! # Pacing a simulation with a clock
//!
//! By default, the simulation uses [`NoClock`](crate::time::NoClock) and
//! operates in tick-less mode, meaning that it effectively runs as fast as
//! possible.
//!
//! In many applications such as hardware-in-the-loop testing, it is instead
//! necessary to run with a real-time clock such as
//! [`SystemClock`](crate::time::SystemClock) or
//! [`AutoSystemClock`](crate::time::AutoSystemClock). Some applications may
//! also require custom real-time or scaled-time clocks implementing the
//! [`Clock`] trait. In all such cases, simulation stepping functions such as
//! [`Simulation::step`] or [`Simulation::run`] would normally periodically
//! block until the clock reaches the next scheduler deadline, making the
//! simulation unresponsive towards [event injection](Injector), [event
//! scheduling](Scheduler) and [halting](Scheduler::halt).
//!
//! To remedy this issue, a [`Ticker`] such as
//! [`PeriodicTicker`](crate::time::PeriodicTicker) can be configured to force
//! the clock to wake up at regular intervals, even if no events are scheduled.
//! This ensures that the simulation regularly yields control back to the
//! simulation controller.
//!
//! Most application requiring a non-default clock are therefore encouraged to
//! set both a clock and a ticker with [`SimInit::with_clock`], although it is
//! also possible to set a tick-less clock using
//! [`SimInit::with_tickless_clock`].

/// The simulation environment.
///
/// A `Simulation` is created by calling [`SimInit::init`] on a simulation bench
/// initializer. It contains an asynchronous executor that runs all simulation
/// models added beforehand to [`SimInit`].
///
/// A [`Simulation`] object also manages an event scheduling queue and
/// simulation time. The scheduling queue can be accessed from the simulation
/// itself, but also from models via the optional [`&mut
/// Context`](crate::model::Context) argument of input and replier port methods.
/// Likewise, simulation time can be accessed with the [`Simulation::time`]
/// method, or from models with the [`Context::time`] method.
///
/// Events and queries can be scheduled immediately, *i.e.* for the current
/// simulation time, using [`process_event`](Simulation::process_event) and
/// [`process_query`](Simulation::process_query). Calling these methods will
/// block until all computations triggered by such event or query have
/// completed. In the case of queries, the response is returned.
///
/// Events can also be scheduled at a future simulation time using one of the
/// [`schedule_*`](Scheduler::schedule_event) method. These methods queue an
/// event without blocking.
///
/// Finally, the [`Simulation`] instance manages simulation time. A call to
/// [`step`](Simulation::step) will:
///
/// 1. increment simulation time until that of the next tick (if a [Ticker] was
///    configured) or of the next scheduled event, whichever is earlier, then
/// 2. call [`Clock::synchronize`] which, unless the simulation is configured to
///    run as fast as possible, blocks until the desired wall clock time, and
///    finally
/// 3. process all events scheduled for that target time (if any) and all
///    pending injected events.
///
/// The [`step_until`](Simulation::step_until) method operates similarly but
/// iterates until the specified simulation time has been reached. Finally,
/// [`run`](Simulation::run) iterates until there are no more events in the
/// scheduler queue or, if a [`Ticker`] was provided, until the
/// [`Scheduler::halt`] method is called.

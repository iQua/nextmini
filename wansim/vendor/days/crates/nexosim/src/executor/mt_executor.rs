//! Multi-threaded `async` executor.
//!
//! The executor is exclusively designed for message-passing computational
//! tasks. As such, it does not include an I/O reactor and does not consider
//! fairness as a goal in itself. While it does use fair local queues inasmuch
//! as these tend to perform better in message-passing applications, it uses an
//! unfair injection queue and a LIFO slot without attempt to mitigate the
//! effect of badly behaving code (e.g. futures that spin-lock by yielding to
//! the executor; there is for this reason no support for something like tokio's
//! `yield_now`).
//!
//! Another way in which it differs from other `async` executors is that it
//! treats deadlocking as a normal occurrence. This is because in a
//! discrete-time simulator, the simulation of a system at a given time step
//! will make as much progress as possible until it technically reaches a
//! deadlock. Only then does the simulator advance the simulated time to that of
//! the next "event" extracted from a time-sorted priority queue.
//!
//! The design of the executor is largely influenced by the tokio and Go
//! schedulers, both of which are optimized for message-passing applications. In
//! particular, it uses fast, fixed-size thread-local work-stealing queues with
//! a non-stealable LIFO slot in combination with an injector queue, which
//! injector queue is used both to schedule new tasks and to absorb temporary
//! overflow in the local queues.
//!
//! The design of the injector queue is kept very simple compared to tokio, by
//! taking advantage of the fact that the injector is not required to be either
//! LIFO or FIFO. Moving tasks between a local queue and the injector is fast
//! because tasks are moved in batch and are stored contiguously in memory.
//!
//! Another difference with tokio is that, at the moment, the complete subset of
//! active worker threads is stored in a single atomic variable. This makes it
//! possible to rapidly identify free worker threads for stealing operations,
//! with the downside that the maximum number of worker threads is currently
//! limited to `usize::BITS`. This is not expected to constitute a limitation in
//! practice since system simulation is not typically embarrassingly parallel.
//!
//! Probably the largest difference with tokio is the task system, which has
//! better throughput due to less need for synchronization. This mainly results
//! from the use of an atomic notification counter rather than an atomic
//! notification flag, thus alleviating the need to reset the notification flag
//! before polling a future.

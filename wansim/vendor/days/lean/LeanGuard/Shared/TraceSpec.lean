/--
Protocol-independent interface for replaying a canonicalized trace.

The executable checker supplies a row type, replay state, initial state, and
one partial transition function. Protocol modules instantiate this structure
with their existing checker step functions.

Replay with a coverage observer. The observer is deliberately observational:
it sees the pre-state and row, updates coverage, and cannot alter replay state
or acceptance.

Coverage observation cannot change the verdict: instrumented replay agrees
with plain replay on acceptance, the final replay state, and the error
message — the observer only threads the coverage component.
